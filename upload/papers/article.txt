I will give you some advice about life.
Eat more roughage;
Do more than others expect you to do and do it pains;
Remember what life tells you;
do not take to heart every thing you hear.
do not spend all that you have.
do not sleep as long as you want;
Whenever you say "I love you", please say it honestly;
Whevever you say "I am sorry", please look into the other person's eyes;
Whenever you find your wrongdoing, be quick with reparation!
Whenever you make a phone call smil when you pick up the phone, because someone feel it!
Understand rules completely and change them reasonably;
Remember, the best love is to love others unconditionally rather than make demands on them;
Comment on the success you have attained by looking in the past at the target you wanted to achieve most;
In love and cooking, you must give 100% effort - but expect little appreciation.
